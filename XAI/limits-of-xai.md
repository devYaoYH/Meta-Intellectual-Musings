# Limits of XAI

*“Science gathers knowledge faster than Society gathers wisdom” – Isaac Asimov.*

Aphorisms catch on precisely because it abstracts a wealth of acute observations behind few words, exemplifying the voluminous content possible with comparatively limited tokens. Penned in the 1980s, with the menace of the Cold War hanging heavy in the air, technological advances threatened to mark an end to life as we knew it. The specter of improperly wielded scientific advances throughout history has plagued humanity’s quest to better its conditions.

To be clear, we have yet to succumb to the folly of entrusting AIs with too much today and have been actively fighting back as a community from researchers to policy makers against the non-judicious application of AI technology. It is worth highlighting a key step in this fight: NeurIPS, a prominent conference at the forefront of AI development, has introduced a necessary “Impact Statement” for all paper submissions stating the “broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences” [[NeurIPS 2020 blogpost](https://neuripsconf.medium.com/getting-started-with-neurips-2020-e350f9b39c28)]. This article is a look behind the scenes of this fight to ensure the ethical application of AI technologies from the perspective of the Explainable AI (XAI) movement, and attempts to show how the lines are always hazier than we think.

# What, Why and How is XAI?

Broadly construed, XAI seeks to develop methods for prying into the black boxes of AI models. In doing so, one seeks to understand how the AI model works to inform an explanation for why it provides certain outputs. The motivation and growing investment into XAI are in no small part due to the recent surge in development of deep neural networks in this past decade. As opposed to traditional symbolic AI models, neural networks operate with a distributed representation of activations spread across many nodes in a network. This distributed nature of meaning within deep neural network models presents us with a very alien form of reasoning than that which we are used to.

Deep neural networks would not have attracted as much attention without the impressive and promising results it has shown thus far. DeepMind’s AlphaGo presented a general model to learn many diverse games and perform better than human players (in Go, Atari, and most recently StarCraft 2). Generative Adversarial Networks can edit video and generate images and text that consistently fool human observers. Such achievements have inched the ability of artificial systems closer to human ability. Consequently, many AI models have found their way into our everyday lives and could come to influence key decision-making positions in our society.

The current rate at which AI gains competence vastly outstrips the rate at which we are formulating guidelines and policies surrounding their use. Our lack of understanding how such systems operate further slows down the latter. How should we then approach understanding this alien system? It is against this backdrop that the XAI movement come into focus in recent years. DARPA states that the goal of XAI is to “enable human users to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging generation of artificially intelligent partners” and that such “systems will have the ability to explain their rationale, characterize their strength and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future.” [[DARPA XAI](https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence)].

From the above DARPA definition of XAI, we can extract two broad thrusts of the movement:

1. Develop tools to interact intelligibly with AI models (Explanatory AI)
2. Develop AI models which are more transparent and interpretable (Interpretable AI)

The two broad thrusts align with the two stages of XAI methods as identified by a review of research literature in XAI by Giulia and Luca: post-hoc and ante-hoc [[Giulia et.al, 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00093.pdf)]. Post-hoc meaning *after the matter* of model output and Ante-hoc meaning *before the matter* of model output. Explanatory methods aligning with post-hoc stage are tools which attempts to review and explain in hindsight why the model has produced the outputs that it has. In contrast, Interpretable methods are focused around designing models which utilize inherently interpretable methods to arrive at their outputs. An example is designing simpler, more linear network architectures instead of an obfuscated architecture such as Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.

Performance and domain-specificity are two main challenges in this direction as identified by Rudin in her paper arguing for the use of interpretable AI over explanatory AI methods [[Rudin, 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10154.pdf)]. Developing simpler, more interpretable models that perform with the same accuracy of Deep CNNs may require intensive effort which corporations employing AI models may not be inclined to invest in. Furthermore, ante-hoc methods by their nature cannot be model-agnostic, what is interpretable depends on the problem that the model is employed to solve, further adding to development costs. This difficulty concurs with the relatively sparse research into interpretable methods as compared with explanatory methods (20% of all research on methods in XAI) [[Giulia et.al, 2020, Figure 4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00093.pdf)].

For both directions, there is a focus on unveiling the mechanistic details of processes within AI models. Understanding of the mechanistic details of a model would be most helpful in understanding the output from such models. However, against the problems that we encounter in a social setting through the employment of AI models, perhaps our notion of explanations needs to be broadened beyond merely illuminating mechanisms.

# What requires explaining? - When Models Fail

The class of tasks surrounding image classification has received much attention over the years as the basis for numerous applications: Object identification and tracking, Image segmentation, and Face recognition to name a few. Face recognition as part of biometrics registration at international customs is already widely deployed in many countries. Driverless cars also requires a robust assessment of its surroundings using some visual system. The correct functioning of image classification models is thus paramount to the success of this wide range of solutions. However, recent literature has identified that it is not difficult to fool AI image classifiers into providing an incorrect output using images that are slightly changed. Furthermore, modifications in such adversarial images are imperceptible to the human eye, rendering their detection harder.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/XAI/img/panda_gibbon.png">
</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Panda obfuscated with noise produces Gibbon. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/adversarial-example-research/">Source</a></p>

In the above example, a distributed pattern of noise is overlaid onto the original image and tricks the model into classifying the modified image as a high-probability gibbon. Furthermore, it is possible to print out such adversarial images or construct an adversarial 3D model and robustly trick models from different angles ([case of a turtle model misidentified as a gun](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16597276/google-ai-image-attacks-adversarial-turtle-rifle-3d-printed)).

Another high profile case of model failure occurred a few years ago when chatbots were gaining traction and finding increased usage in customer service domains. Framed as an experiment in "conversational understanding", Microsoft released a Twitter bot called Tay which posted tweets and replied to user's tweets in the public domain. Although initially innocuous, it quickly learned to parrot inappropriate tweets from users resulting in Microsoft shutting the experiment down within 24hours.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/XAI/img/tay_ai_twitter_bot.png">
</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Tweet responding to Tay AI's increasingly inappropriate tweets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist">Source</a></p>

In the previous case of the misidentified panda, no modifications were made to the AI model's internal structure, such panda-gibbon attacks merely amplify already present edge-cases within the model. However, with this case of the inappropriate chatbot, it is the learning mechanism that has been hijacked and exploited to produce undesired results from the AI model. Such an 'attack', although possibly unintentional, highlights the importance of training data in model construction. Machine learning AI models are shackled by the curse of scale. More data and more processing power have drastically improved their ability, but they are nonetheless still limited by the quality of data that goes into training them. Here, we observe that by poisoning the data from which an AI model learns, it is possible to control the output from such models and for a malicious party, bias such models towards undesirable outcomes.

# Function of explanations

Against a background of increasingly pressing problems with today's AI models, the XAI movements hopes to provide solutions to these problems by generating explanations for model outputs as well as increasing the transparency of such models. In the recent review of research in XAI, Giulia and Luca surmises that there are four main purposes XAI sees in explanations [[Giulia et.al, 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00093.pdf)]:

- Explain to *justify*: explanations increase justifiability of decisions based on model output
- Explain to *control*: explanations should enhance transparency, allowing its debugging and identification of potential flaws
- Explain to *improve*: explanations help with improving the accuracy and efficiency of models
- Explain to *discover*: explanations support extraction of novel knowledge and learning of relationships and patterns

For the earlier examples of adversarial attacks, it is clear that the role of explanations in those cases would be to improve our ability to detect such possible flaws in our models as well as make improvements to defend against these adversarial attacks. Furthermore, in such cases as the unfortunate Tesla incident, the ability to offer explanations as to why its autopilot made the decisions it did could add weight in a legal setting. Lastly, explanations could elucidate AlphaGo's famous 37th move against Lee Sedol that expert commentators saw as a "very strange move" and one not within human playbooks [[WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/two-moves-alphago-lee-sedol-redefined-future/)].

Crucially, we observe that the review identified roles of explanations which are mostly post-hoc and focused around the actions and workings of the model. This is a first indication of the limits of what we can come to expect from the XAI movement, it is very much an engineering field that currently looks inwards to produce tools which help to better such models. Contrasted against the problems it attempts to position itself to solve, such an engineering focus appears lacking. This is not to dismiss the importance of such tools currently produced by XAI, rather, it is a call to reign back some of our expectations for this emerging field due to the nature of questions we pose it.

There are two types of situations requiring explanations. In the first case, we wish to interrogate whether our models have indeed functioned in a way that we designed it to or to determine that they are functioning in an expected fashion. This is the type of situation involving adversarial examples in the misidentification of images by image classification models. In the second case, even if we have a correctly functioning model, if it provides unsuitable results in context of its application, we should wish to interrogate this model for an explanation as to why it has behaved so. When we employ AI models within a *social* context, then it no longer operates as an isolated tool but one which is embedded in and for which we require *social* explanations. It is the first type of situations that calls for and can be resolved by XAI methods. However, to expect XAI to supply explanations for the second would be currently unrealistic and wholly insufficient.

# Case study: Google Cloud Explainable AI

Google's Cloud Explainable AI offers 3 main services: AI Explanations, What-If Tool and Continuous evaluation. It should be pointed out that this product is model-agnostic, meaning that there is no modification to the underlying model, rather it is a tool to be applied on-top of a trained model. In other words, a post-hoc approach. AI Explanation service offers 'Feature Attributions': "signed per-feature attribution score proportional to the feature's contribution to the model's prediction" [[Google, AI Explanations Whitepaper](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-ai-whitepapers/AI%20Explainability%20Whitepaper.pdf)]. This is a service focused towards exposing the inner workings of model predictions based on input features. More interesting are the What-If and Continuous evaluation tools.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/XAI/img/google_explainable_ai.png">
</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Figure 3:</strong> An overview of the features Google's Cloud Explainable AI service offers <a href="https://cloud.google.com/explainable-ai#features">Source</a></p>

Rather than simply statically identifying the salient features in a model's prediction, the [What-If Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/index.html#demos) allows one to modify datapoints and introduce what-if sample points to observe the examined model's predictions. This is an interactive tool that can be deployed after a model has been trained and serve as a way of visualizing how the model performs on different datasets. Lastly, the [Continuous evaluation tool](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/prediction/docs/continuous-evaluation) monitors a deployed model by sampling datapoints against human-evaluated results. For example, a model can be queried with an image classification request and the same image is sent to the deployed AI model as well as human evaluators. The results from the model is then compared against human evaluation responses and reported intermittently.

Google's Explainable AI takes a promising step by shifting focus from the raw numbers to interaction with human evaluators of the model. Explanations as per this tool is driven not only by mathematical tools employed to extract pertinent features relevant to model predictions but through interactions with human questioners. However, at its core, such a product is still driven by a post-hoc approach: treating models as something akin to an engine and examining mechanistic details within them to produce 'explanations'.

### Explanatory v.s. Interpretable AI

There is pressure for XAI to move away from asking post-hoc questions to modifying our models themselves to function in a way that is 'self-explanatory', in other words, for us to prefer interpretable AI rather than explanatory AI. In her widely cited 2019 paper, Cynthia Rudin writes that "trying to *explain* black box models, rather than creating models that are *interpretable* in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practices and can potentially cause catastrophic harm to society". She points out 2 main reasons for her assessment [[Rudin, 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10154.pdf)]:

1. Explainable ML methods provide explanations that are not faithful to what the original model computes
2. Explanations often do not make sense, or do not provide enough detail to understand what the black box is doing

The first point highlights the pitfall that by constructing tools which help reveal *some* inner working of the black box model, we are not guaranteed to find *the* inner workings which are pertinent in the model's decision processes. There are many ways in which salient features can be identified from model output and inputs. Google's product utilizes a Sampled Shapley measure, many alternatives exist in research literature and it has been pointed out that we currently do not have a good way to evaluate which saliency measure should be preferred [[Giulia et.al, 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00093.pdf)].

The second point is hinted at within Google's whitepaper: "Similar to how model predictions are prone to adversarial attacks, attributions are prone to the same". Even with attributions at hand, comparing between attributions given for a correct classification versus an incorrect classification may reveal no useful differences in what salient features have been identified. Alternatively, two different sets of salient features may be identified for the same classification problem instance. Once again this makes us question just what such saliency information provides us with other than perhaps confirming some preconceived human bias as to what should have been pertinent features decision process needs to take into account.

# Types of Explanations

With the current extent of XAI in mind, both post-hoc and ante-hoc approaches, we can finally review its limits by considering more broadly just what sort of explanations are produced by XAI methods. Classically, Aristotle classified explanations into 4 categories [[Andrea Falcon, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Aristotle on Causality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/#FouCau)]:

- Efficient Cause: "primary source of the change" (Causal explanation)
- Final Cause: "the end, that for the sake of which a thing is done" (Functional explanation)
- Formal Cause: "the form" (Categorical explanation)
- Material Cause: "that out of which" (Constituent explanation)

These four categories broadly guide what kind of answers we give to 'why' questions. Why is something the way it is? We can answer such a question by examining the chain of causes that led to the even under question (causal explanation). We can also refer to the function of the event to draw answers from. For some events the heuristic of category membership may be sufficient, though more often than not such a heuristic is prone to bias. Lastly, we can also refer to the parts that makes up the event under question for an explanation (what it consists in). These forms of explanations are all within reach of present-day XAI methods as an examination of the model under question will suffice. However, there is yet another form of explanations, one which we briefly pointed out earlier: *social* explanations that XAI will find difficulty in addressing.

Cognitive Psychologist Tania Lombrozo points out that explanations are both a product and a process [[Tania Lombrozo, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661306002117)]. In Tim Miller's review of XAI from a social sciences perspective, he builds upon this and argues that there are 3 areas of explanations we need to consider [[Tim Miller, 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.07269.pdf)]:

1. Cognitive process: "process of abductive inference for 'filling the gaps' to determine an explanation for a given event"
2. Product: "explanation that results from the cognitive process"
3. Social process: "transferring knowledge between explainer and explainee ... goal is that the explainee has enough information to understand the *causes* of the event"

Explanatory AI methods can in time come to fulfil the first cognitive process and interpretable AI places the social process in the forefront of its goals. However, I propose that there is yet another aspect to the social explanatory process that is not concerned with the veridical identification or transmission of causes. Explanations serve a further social role of ascertaining membership. That is to say, we ask for explanations as justification for holding social roles. Under such roles, we come to expect agents to act within constraints associated with such a role. This form of explanations may not entirely be concerned with ascertaining causal attributions. Rather, we may instead be more concerned with the persuasiveness of explanations and furthermore, establishing agency to continue performing within its social role.

For instance, for AI models that approve bank loan, we place such a model within a position with social influence and power, entrusting that it does not violate rules and expectations of the society it operates in. These include a commitment to reducing systemic bias and socio-economic stratification. However, bias is inevitable, even human actors are not exempt from the charge of implicit biases (for instance in workplace hiring practices). A notable concern for our AI model is that they would exacerbate and amplify our human biases much faster than humans (they are, after all, trained on human data - like the unfortunate case of Microsoft's Tay AI chatbot). What we may be looking for instead of the absence of bias is the commitment to ensuring such biases are promptly identified and suitably mitigated.

It is just this agency to act within social roles we place AI models in that does not exist within AI models (yet). If XAI continues to focus its gaze within models rather than looking more broadly to the environment it acts in, we will never be able to find the satisfactory explanations we seek. This is because for our present AI models, they do not contain an awareness of their internal processes nor have the agency to make changes to their model architecture.

# Distinguishing between Diagnostics and Explanation

In the last section, we examined the different aspects of explanations and a class of explanations, *social* explanations, that I argue XAI currently cannot satisfactorily produce. I will next argue that it is best to view present techniques of XAI as producing not explanations but diagnostics. Explanations as a social construct should strictly include social agents (humans) in the loop and it would be prudent to treat present results from the field of XAI as mere diagnostic tools to avoid confusion and granting such tools too much authority.

Not all explanations are established on the basis of diagnostics, though diagnostics can inform explanations, in particular when the sort of explanations we want are of model function rather of model behavior (in a social context). The term 'diagnostics' here is used in its dictionary definition: "methods or systems for discovering the cause of a problem" [[Cambridge Business English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/diagnostic)]. Diagnostics for complex systems such as AI models may also serve the additional purpose during normal functioning as monitoring tools as well. Seen in this sense, the methods put forth by XAI reviewed so far would be better classified as this category of diagnostic tools rather than standing in as explanations by their own right.

An analogy can be drawn to Air Crash Investigations. In the unfortunate case of airplane accidents, the recovery of the plane's [Flight Recorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder) (also known as a black box) is but the first step in forming an investigative report into the accident. The data recorded by flight recorders contain a slice of the plane's flight history, preserving the state of the plane moments before the accident. From this data, investigators may be able to hypothesize what caused the accident by identifying anomalous parameters recorded by the black box. However, in many cases, the causes for airplane accidents do not lie entirely within the plane's state prior to the accident. Rather, the plane exists within the larger context of the flight industry which contains its pilots, maintenance crews, and regulations regarding flight paths and operating procedures. In addition, a key aspect of the final investigative report is to not only identify causes for the accident but recommendations for preventing future accidents from happening. Furthermore, this investigative report also serves to assuage the public of the flight industry's reliability as well as address bereaved families' concerns. In this way, explanations for airplane accidents do not merely contain the causal aspect (which may already exceed the bounds of a plane's black box) but a social aspect of fulfilling the responsibility the flight industry has to its customers.

In a similar fashion, our investigations into AI models must not stop from uncovering what's within the black box (AI models), but to look beyond and place the model within its social context. But to do so, we do indeed still require transparency into the inner workings of our AI models in order to make an informed explanation of its behavior. Rather than expecting that XAI would resolve the problems we have employing AI models in a social context, we should instead acknowledge its present limits to inform what steps we still need to take to move forward.

# XAI not merely as a way of looking back, but looking forwards

We started with defining goals for XAI and identified two main approaches taken so far: Explanatory AI and Interpretable AI. Next, we identified that the current focus of XAI is to develop methods that looks into our AI models to produce explanations. Thereafter, we reviewed how explanations help in cases where our AI models have failed in addition to a review of a commercial XAI product, Google's Cloud Explainable AI. Finally, we disambiguated what types of explanations exist and made the discrimination between diagnostics and explanations, arguing that current XAI results fall into the former category of diagnostics.

Admittedly XAI is a fast developing field with fluid goals and it would be unfair at this point to burden XAI with too much that lies outside its scope. Although broadly, like the DARPA definition, we want to be able to understand and trust AI models that we increasingly find making decisions with social impact (be it bank loans, filtering resumes, or driverless cars). And to this end, we find that the emerging field of XAI holds most promise in resolving this gap in our understanding. In some sense, we are directing our questions surrounding the justification of using AI models towards this field of XAI, hinging on it producing satisfactory explanations that fulfils our need for such justifications.

However, we need to acknowledge that XAI is very much an engineering discipline and what explanations we require for the judicial usage of AI models in a social setting may exceed the current boundaries of what it can produce. With this worry, many reviews of XAI have suggested that it incorporate methods and studies from diverse disciplines such as the social sciences, philosophy and law. To this end, I shall make two closing recommendations for the field of XAI.

The first short-term recommendation is to reign back some of our present hopes and expectations for XAI by shifting our perspective to view current XAI products as mere diagnostic tools rather than full-fledged explanations. This shift would hopefully prompt some hesitation and additional requirements onto current XAI products by not considering results from the field as 'explanations' in the full, socially-rich sense of the term.

The second long-term recommendation is to identify an additional direction XAI can take that is somewhat distinct from the two previous thrusts identified:

3. Bake into AI models an awareness of its internal processes (Ratiocinative AI)

This third direction I argue is an underlying goal that can drive the previous two to fruition as a result of fulfilling this goal as well. When multi-layer artificial neural networks were first proposed in the 1980s and 1990s, a rich debate in Philosophy erupted from the proposed shift away from symbolic reasoning systems (expert systems) towards a distributed connectionist paradigm (deep neural networks). Much of the hesitation in philosophy towards endorsing the connectionist paradigm as one that can stand up to a theory for our notion of cognition and intelligence is that they do not appear to be able to perform the feats of propositional logic that is the cornerstone of human reasoning capabilities.

In Rosenberg's critical take on connectionism, *Connectionism and Cognition*, he argues that the "mere exercise of a discrimination capacity, however complex, is not yet an example of *cognition*" [(Jay F. Rosenberg, 1990, p297)](https://philosophy.tamucc.edu/graphics/berkich/texts/rosenberg_jay-connectionism_and_cognition.pdf) and identifies connectionist networks as capable of merely discrimination by following certain rules. Deep neural networks today still, however powerful, *are* in fact only discriminating between classes of labels. In addition to being rule-conforming (rational), Rosenberg argues in his paper that for truly cognizant systems, they should be rule-aware (ratiocinative) as well. Just so, I believe that for us to eventually develop tools that enable fruitful dialogue between humans and our AI models, we should imbue our AI models with an awareness of its internal processes.

What this awareness should be and how it can be implemented is currently unclear. However, present research in Reinforcement Learning agents paints a promising path for us to achieve this goal. Building on top of its previous successes, DeepMind's recent MuZero agent is able to learn both the rules surrounding permissible actions within its environment as well as an optimal policy to act within this environment [[DeepMind, MuZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules)]. The level of 'internal processes' should also be disambiguated. Less so do we ask for an explanation on why we have misheard something than why we have acted upon such false information in the way that we have (explanation focus on why driverless car got into an accident rather than why the stop sign was misclassified). MuZero's awareness of internal rules and policies that is learnt through interacting with the environment is similarly built upon deep neural networks, but the level at which we can direct it questions appears to conform more to the type of social explanations that presupposes an awareness of rules and agency to change those rules than current AI models.

In time, the XAI movement can not only serve the purpose of examining presently available systems in an effort to *make sense of* how and why they function but could further serve the purpose of pushing us towards truly intelligent systems.
