# Not Orthogonal and Not Diagonal - Oblique and Otiose

What is left from a rejection of both the Orthogonality thesis and the Diagonality thesis? Jessica argues for an in-between of sorts in the Obliqueness thesis. The Orthogonality thesis roughly states that there is no correlation between degrees of intelligence and what values the intelligent entity holds. Conversely, the Diagonality thesis states that in the limit of (super)intelligence, all entities converge upon the same set of values. In rejecting both theses, Jessica introduces an Obliqueness thesis which states that the degree of intelligence consists in some relation to the set of values an entity has.

I wonder if a simpler presentation of the author’s main thesis will be helpful in elucidating its key implications and suggestions for further exploration. Roughly, I take it that in arguing for the Obliqueness thesis:

- **P1**) Some beliefs are inaccessible (or tends to be unavailable) to entities below a certain threshold of intelligence (*argument from bayes/VNM*)
- **P2**) More capable intelligences tend to adopt beliefs that more accurately reflect reality (*argument from ontological change*)
- **P1 + P2 = SC1**) The beliefs of an entity depends on its level of intelligence
- **P3**) Values are sensitive to beliefs an entity holds (*argument from value-relevant symmetries / argument from brain messiness*)
- **C**) Values are sensitive to the level of intelligence of an entity

The above formulation more formally ties together the various piecemeal arguments made throughout Jessica’s essay into a cogent argument for some correlation between the degree of an entity’s intelligence and the values that it holds.
