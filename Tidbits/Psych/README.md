## Tensions in psychology

Firstly, there are some recurring themes in psychology where two sides of a coin are put in tension with each other and many of the 'heuristics' uncovered by psychological experiments are explained one way or the other based on which side the coin lands on.

### System 1 v.s. System 2
Or also known as the [Dual Process Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory): Cognitive processes proceed along two simultaneous pathways: one automatic, unconscious, fast, low-effort (System 1); the other explicit, conscious, slow, high-effort (System 2).
    - Applied generally to a broad range of psychological settings where changing the timescale of a decision process/experiment changes the subjects' responses systematically. E.g. Linguistic association tasks, memory recall, learning, social appraisal (of situations/others)...

### Nature v.s. Nurture
How much of our behavior/cognition is the result of pre-determined biological factors (genetics for instance - although not entirely true, see body of research on environmental regulation of gene expression) or experience-driven developmental factors.
    - The debate in language between Chomsky (Nature) and Skinner (Nurture) looms big on psychology.

### Individualism v.s. Collectivism
When cross-cultural studies are conducted, a common dimension to explain differences along is how Individualist v.s. Collectivist the communities under study generally are. Where Western communities are believed to be predominantly individualist, Eastern communities are believed to be predominantly collectivist.
    - [Individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism): Emphasis on worth of individual choices/value/traits/interests
    - [Collectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism): Emphasis on cohesion within social group

## Problems in psychology

The conduct of psychology is not without its many problems. Lately, replication has been a notable issue. The effect-size of psychological studies are depressingly small, researchers would jump over an R^2-value of 0.3 as pretty high... The large variance in individual human behavior does not help much as the range of 'control variables' are hard to identify and too numerous to actually ensure a proper controlled experiment is carried out.

### WEIRD population
Due to higher availability of US college kids as the subject of psychological studies, many fall into the trap of extrapolating to 'general population' from the WEIRD (White, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) group.

### Common-Cause Fallacy (or Third Variable Problem)
When a correlation is established between two variables, researchers tend to abductively claim one to be the *cause* of the other. However, this could be a case where both variables are caused by a third, unknown and hidden variable that is the common cause of the observed correlation. For example: the empty fuel-gauge on my car causes my car to stop (wrong! Common-cause, actual amount of fuel in fuel-tank).

### Prediction v.s. Explanation
It has historically been believed (in the philosophy of science) that there is a symmetry between Explanation and Prediction: that to explain is to show that one can predict, and that to predict presents a suitable explanation. However, this has now largely fallen out of the received view in philosophy, many problems exist for this proposed symmetry. One can predict the position of the sun from the shadow that objects cast. However, it is unsatisfactory to claim that the shadow thus cast *explains* the position of the sun. This philosophical preamble serves to distangle the perceived symmetry between predictions and explanations. Psychological modelling has historically focused on explanations (which factors correspond to manipulated experimental conditions?) than making predictions (how would a subject respond under such conditions?). Psychology is now moving to incorporate the large body of recent work in Machine Learning to make models that *predict* to further study in the field ([Yarkoni and Westfall, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603289/)).

## List of Tidbits

Here's a collection of relatively famous Psychological experiments and one-liner rules-of-thumb on the human condition. I like to think of psychology as uncovering **heuristics** of the human mind.

- [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect): Incompetent people are oblivious to their incompetencies.

- [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error): We disproportionately ascribe dispositional judgements unto others and situational attributions to ourselves.
    - Dispositional judgements: character traits (smart, tall, hardworking, lazy...)
    - Situational attributions: external (social) environmental factors (can afford to go to private school)

- ["Above-average" Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority): More than 50% of people self-report as 'above average'. (contradiction - we are not good judges of *general population statistics*)

- ["False-consensus" Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect): People have a strong belief that their own prespectives and opinions are correct and shared by others.

- [Anchoring Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)): Initially-presented information disproportionately affect our subsequent decisions.

- [Availability Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic): When making probabilistic judgements, we weigh easily recallable events with higher probability.
    - Usually translates to more recent or immediate events.
    - Frequency in memory ~ p(event) [fallacy]

- [Framing Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)): When two objectively identical (results-oriented) decisions are framed differently (linguistically), subjects' decisions differ systematically.
    - e.g. Risk loom larger than losses (positivity framing -> risk adverse | negativity framing -> risk tolerant): We tend to take risky options to avoid something framed as a 'loss' when in fact the options presented to us result in identical outcomes.

- [Conjunction Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy): We judge a more specific event to be more probable than the general event.
    - We think: p(Linda is Bank Teller & Linda is active in feminist movement) > p(Linda is Bank Teller).
    - Explanation due to availability heuristic or a matching to our preconceived notion of 'Linda'.
    - When explicitly presented as a *frequency* evaluation (e.g. How many out of 100 people will fit the following descriptions?), this effect is significantly attenuated.

- [Affective Forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_forecasting): We *think* we are pretty good judges of our emotions under hypothetical situations but we're likely not.
    - Misconstrual: Simulation of the hypothetical situation is usually clouded by contextual factors *now* and we fail to make veridical predictions.
    - Intensity & Duration: Subjects typically think that some event will make them feel more strongly and for longer periods of time than it actually does.

- [Change Blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_blindness): We are overconfident in our perception of changes to the environment.
    - When we attend to spcific tasks, usually other irrelevant changes in the stimuli are ignored. However, subjects are nonetheless confident in their ability to identify changes if there were in fact changes (there are, and subjects did not notice them).
    - [Example task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGQmdoK_ZfY): Did you notice the change?
