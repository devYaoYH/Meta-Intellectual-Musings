## Tensions in psychology

Firstly, there are some recurring themes in psychology where two sides of a coin are put in tension with each other and many of the 'heuristics' uncovered by psychological experiments are explained one way or the other based on which side the coin lands on.

### System 1 v.s. System 2
Or also known as the [Dual Process Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory): Cognitive processes proceed along two simultaneous pathways: one automatic, unconscious, fast, low-effort (System 1); the other explicit, conscious, slow, high-effort (System 2).
- Applied generally to a broad range of psychological settings where changing the timescale of a decision process/experiment changes the subjects' responses systematically. E.g. Linguistic association tasks, memory recall, learning, social appraisal (of situations/others)...

### Nature v.s. Nurture
How much of our behavior/cognition is the result of pre-determined biological factors (genetics for instance - although not entirely true, see body of research on environmental regulation of gene expression) or experience-driven developmental factors.
- The debate in language between Chomsky (Nature) and Skinner (Nurture) looms big on psychology.

### Individualism v.s. Collectivism
When cross-cultural studies are conducted, a common dimension to explain differences along is how Individualist v.s. Collectivist the communities under study generally are. Where Western communities are believed to be predominantly individualist, Eastern communities are believed to be predominantly collectivist.
- [Individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism): Emphasis on worth of individual choices/value/traits/interests
- [Collectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism): Emphasis on cohesion within social group

## Problems in psychology

The conduct of psychology is not without its many problems. Lately, replication has been a notable issue. The effect-size of psychological studies are depressingly small, researchers would jump over an R^2-value of 0.3 as pretty high... The large variance in individual human behavior does not help much as the range of 'control variables' are hard to identify and too numerous to actually ensure a proper controlled experiment is carried out.

### WEIRD population
Due to higher availability of US college kids as the subject of psychological studies, many fall into the trap of extrapolating to 'general population' from the WEIRD (White, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) group.

### Common-Cause Fallacy (or Third Variable Problem)
When a correlation is established between two variables, researchers tend to abductively claim one to be the *cause* of the other. However, this could be a case where both variables are caused by a third, unknown and hidden variable that is the common cause of the observed correlation. For example: the empty fuel-gauge on my car causes my car to stop (wrong! Common-cause, actual amount of fuel in fuel-tank).

### Prediction v.s. Explanation
It has historically been believed (in the philosophy of science) that there is a symmetry between Explanation and Prediction: that to explain is to show that one can predict, and that to predict presents a suitable explanation. However, this has now largely fallen out of the received view in philosophy, many problems exist for this proposed symmetry. One can predict the position of the sun from the shadow that objects cast. However, it is unsatisfactory to claim that the shadow thus cast *explains* the position of the sun. This philosophical preamble serves to distangle the perceived symmetry between predictions and explanations. Psychological modelling has historically focused on explanations (which factors correspond to manipulated experimental conditions?) than making predictions (how would a subject respond under such conditions?). Psychology is now moving to incorporate the large body of recent work in Machine Learning to make models that *predict* to further study in the field ([Yarkoni and Westfall, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6603289/)).

## List of Tidbits

Here's a collection of relatively famous Psychological experiments and one-liner rules-of-thumb on the human condition. I like to think of psychology as uncovering **heuristics** of the human mind.

- [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect): Incompetent people are oblivious to their incompetencies.

- [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error): We disproportionately ascribe dispositional judgements unto others and situational attributions to ourselves.
    - Dispositional judgements: character traits (smart, tall, hardworking, lazy...)
    - Situational attributions: external (social) environmental factors (can afford to go to private school)

- ["Above-average" Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority): More than 50% of people self-report as 'above average'. (contradiction - we are not good judges of *general population statistics*)

- ["False-consensus" Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect): People have a strong belief that their own prespectives and opinions are correct and shared by others.

- [Anchoring Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)): Initially-presented information disproportionately affect our subsequent decisions.

- [Availability Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic): When making probabilistic judgements, we weigh easily recallable events with higher probability.
    - Usually translates to more recent or immediate events.
    - Ease of recall ~ p(event) [fallacy]

- [Representativeness Heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representativeness_heuristic): Matching the perceived event to our preconceived notion of prototypically similar events.
    - Judged as more similar => more probable [fallacy]

- [Framing Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)): When two objectively identical (results-oriented) decisions are framed differently (linguistically), subjects' decisions differ systematically.
    - e.g. Risk loom larger than losses (positivity framing -> risk adverse | negativity framing -> risk tolerant): We tend to take risky options to avoid something framed as a 'loss' when in fact the options presented to us result in identical outcomes.

- [Conjunction Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy): We judge a more specific event to be more probable than the general event.
    - We think: p(Linda is Bank Teller & Linda is active in feminist movement) > p(Linda is Bank Teller).
    - Explanation due to availability heuristic or representativeness heuristic.
    - When explicitly presented as a *frequency* evaluation (e.g. How many out of 100 people will fit the following descriptions?), this effect is significantly attenuated.

- [Affective Forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_forecasting): We *think* we are pretty good judges of our emotions under hypothetical situations but we're likely not.
    - Misconstrual: Simulation of the hypothetical situation is usually clouded by contextual factors *now* and we fail to make veridical predictions.
    - Intensity & Duration: Subjects typically think that some event will make them feel more strongly and for longer periods of time than it actually does.

- [Change Blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_blindness): We are overconfident in our perception of changes to the environment.
    - When we attend to spcific tasks, usually other irrelevant changes in the stimuli are ignored. However, subjects are nonetheless confident in their ability to identify changes if there were in fact changes (there are, and subjects did not notice them).
    - [Example task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGQmdoK_ZfY): Did you notice the change?

- [Cognitive Dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance): We seek consistency between our internal beliefs and external behavior. When actions' resultant or anticipatory effect conflicts with our beliefs, we seek to reestablish consistency by changing attitudes or behaviors.
    - Can be used to explain the 'sunk cost' fallacy when action taken cannot be changed, adjusted attitude results in continued investment
    - Initial Investment -> Anticipated negative appraisal -> Adjustment of attitudes to reestablish consistency

- Dual-Process Models for Persuation: The two prominent theories are highly similar ([Heuristic-Systematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic-systematic_model_of_information_processing) and [Elaboration-Likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaboration_likelihood_model)). Depending on how invested we are in the issue at hand and how intelligeble is the persuasive message, we may employ either a Systematic/Central or Heuristic/Peripheral stance towards evaluating the persuasiveness of the message.
    - Systematic/Central Stance (High motivation on issue): Quality of Argument
    - Heuristic/Peripheral Stance (Low motivation on issue): Who is delivering the message, number/length of arguments.

- [Prevention-Detection Persuation framing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10865-018-9972-1): "Depending on the behavioural function (prevention or detection of illness), either a **gain-frame (for preventive action)** or a **loss-frame (for detection behaviour)** is theorized to be more persuasive. The idea behind the interaction between message frame and behavioural function is rooted in prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), whereby preferences for one of two choices are different, depending upon how these outcomes are framed, even though the factual outcomes are equal." (Brujin, 2018, *emphasis mine*)

- [Solomon Asch Conformity Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments): When presented with systematic group responses, an individual may shift personal responses to conform with the group.
    - Initial famous experiment presented a group of confederates and only 1 actual participant (who answered last) with a series of line-length similarity judgements (which line A,B,C is most similar in length to this one?).
    - When confederates give consistently poor estimates, after a few trials, subject also gave similarly poor estimates.
    - In follow-up experiments, this observed conformity effect is largely attenuated when subject gives private written responses even after listening to group response. (publically-perceived behavior drives this effect)
    - *Normative Influence*: When the right answer is known clearly but individual may agree to group on basis of conforming to perceived social norms.
    - *Informative Influence*: When the right answer is hard to determine, individual may agree to group on basis of belief that the group has privileged information.

- Compliance Strategies: Strategies for increasing successful compliance from others to a given request
    - [Foot-in-the-door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique): Make an initial small request before the targeted request
    - [Door-in-the-face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique): Make an initial huge request before the (perceived more reasonable) targeted request (only works if the same individual issues both requests)

- [Mere Exposure Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect): Mere increased exposure to something increases our liking or preference for that thing.
    - [Festinger MIT Dormitory Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_principle): Evidence for this effect in the domain of forming friendships. Families who live closer to each other in the study have increased chance of forming friendships.
    - Linguistic preference: More frequent words in English are judged to be more preferrable.
    - Potential explanations:
        - Anticipated interactions can increase liking.
        - Repeated exposure to stimulus makes it easier to be processed, which has a positive feedback effect.
