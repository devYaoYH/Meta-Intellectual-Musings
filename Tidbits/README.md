# Knowledge Nuggets

The [extended mind view of cognition](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/#EmbCogExtMinThe) states that our cognitive processing are not brain-bound or body-bound, rather, the external world that we interact with plays a significant role in our cognition. This is a contemporary on-going and hotly debated topic in the philosophy of mind. In any case, it would not seem unreasonable to claim that our cognitive faculties are limited and we utilize external objects and tools to aid in demanding cognitive tasks. Although one would like to claim that one maintains a complete and coherent knowledge base at all times, that is unfortunately unlikely the case. One only caches a subset of knowledge to working memory and further recall is a slow process (DISK->RAM->L3-Cache takes ~10 orders of magnitude slower than on-chip Cache access). Furthermore, certain nuggets of knowledge are lost to the void of time as one gains more experience... Therefore, what follows is a working scratchpad or cache of particularly interesting nuggets of information that can be easily referenced when the need arise.
